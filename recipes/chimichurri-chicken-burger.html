                <p>If you showed up at a cookout where you heard they were making burgers, 
                    but once you got there you realized they were talking about chicken burgers, 
                    would you be excited or profoundly disappointed? That’s what I thought. Me too.
                    When your mouth is ready for juicy and flavorful, something dry and bland just won’t do, 
                    which is why I was so thrilled with how these chimichurri chicken burgers turned out. 
                    They weren’t just comparable, but maybe even…better? Okay, that might be a stretch, 
                    but the fact that I was even having those thoughts is a great indication of just how much 
                    I enjoyed these. </p>

            <h2>STEPS</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>To make chimichurri, chop herbs with a sharp knife until fine; add sliced garlic to the mixture. Continue chopping until mixture is very fine; transfer to a bowl. Stir in the 1/4 cup olive oil, white wine vinegar, the 1/4 teaspoon salt, black pepper, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Wrap and refrigerate until needed.
                </li>

                <li>To make burgers, place chicken thighs in the freezer until firm and half-frozen, about 30 minutes.
                </li>
                
                <li>Place thighs on a cutting board, and using a large sharp knife or heavy cleaver, chop until it resembles coarsely ground meat. (Alternatively, place chicken in a food processor; pulse on and off, scraping sides often, until texture resembles coarsely ground meat.)
                </li>
                
                <li>Transfer chicken to a bowl, add the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 cup chimichurri sauce. Use a fork to mix thoroughly.
                </li>
                
                <li>Using damp hands, form chicken mixture into 4 equal-sized patties, about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 30 minutes.
                </li>
                
                <li>Stir together mayonnaise and  remaining chimichurri sauce to make spread for buns; refrigerate until needed.
                </li>
                
                <li>Remove burgers from the fridge; sprinkle both sides with breadcrumbs.
                </li>
                
                <li>Add olive oil to a large non-stick skillet and set over medium high heat. When hot, but before oil starts smoking, add burgers, and cook about 5 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C).
                </li>
                
                <li>Let burgers rest for a minute or two. Serve on buns spread with chimichurri mayo and the fixings of your choice.
                </li>
